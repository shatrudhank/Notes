Page Life Cycle

PreInit
Create or re-create dynamic controls.
Set a master page dynamically.
Set the Theme property dynamically.
it checks the IsPostBack property and determines whether the page is a postback. 

Init
Use this event to read or initialize control properties.

PreLoad 
 PreLoad occurs before the post back data is loaded in the controls. 


Validation controls are used to ensure if, the data, entered by the user is valid. Microsoft asp.net framework, provides 6 built-in validation controls. 
1. RequiredFieldValidator
2. RangeValidator 
3. RegularExpressionValidator
4. CompareValidator
5. CustomValidator    
6. ValidationSummary 

If in a validation control we specify 
1.Text and error message then text value will be displayed, error message will be displayed in validation summary.
2.Error message the message value will be displayed

InitailValue property of validator is used to ignore inital value while validation.Example select gender in dropdownlist  

Page.IsValid is used at server side to check whether page data is valid or not.


RangeValidator- we need to specify Maximumvalue,MinimumValue and type(int,date,string) 

By default validator use visibilaty css.  if there is more then one validator for a field use display property set to dyanamic to avoid space occupied by one of the validator.


In compare validator we can use ControlToCompare for a control and valueToCompare for fixed values.
Specify DataType ,Operator , ControlToCompare ,valueToCompare in compare validator


Use submitbehaviour property of a button to called on pressing enter button.
HyperLinkcontrol 
1.Generate anchor tag. 
2.Url in urlbar changes
3.Browser remebers the history
4.There is no server side operation

Response.Redirect
1. It is done at server
2. Two request-response cycle occurs
 
Server.Transfer
1.Request.Form Page.Previous combines with findcontrol can be used to get previous page data.
2.Server.Transfer can be used to navigate page within the server.
3.It maintains previous page data.
4.Url doesnot change

Server.Execute

Server.Transfer terminate execute of current page and start execution of new webform.whereas in server>exectue the control return back to initial 
webform after completion of next webform page.



Technique to send data from one webform to another
1.Cross Page Postback
 To get data by Page.Previous and use find control or property
2.Query String
     we can use multiple query string seprated by Apersand (&). We should use Server.UrlEncode to avoid case of special symbol(&)
3.Cookies
  Cookies are used to store small amount of information on client machine.
  A.Persitent Cookies- Persistent cookies are those cookies which remain in client machine even after closing the browser.We need to set the time.
  B.Non persistent - The cookies get lost once the browser window is closed. If we dont specify time then it is non persistent.

4.Session
  session state variable can be stored at
   1.InProc
   2.StateServer
   3.SqlServer
   4.Off
   5.Custom(oracle)

   Session state variable is stored at server to remeber the user it uses session id. This session id can be stored in cookie and cookieless. 
   when session mode is inproc the session variable is stored at worker process(executable file w3wp.exe)

   webgarden- webapplication deployed on server with multiple processor
   webfarm-  webapllication deployed on multiple server
   session state variable can be stores at sql server, inproc, state server.
    we cannot use mode =inproc in webgarden and webfarm.
    From performance point of view inproc is efficent. 

    when session state mode=stateserver the session state variable is stored at asp.net state service. 
    State server can have dedicated server we need to specify connection string.It is a window servive.
    This can solve the issue of webfarm and webgarden.
    Less efficient then inproc.


Application state variable is multiuser global data whereas session state is variable is single session global data.
Application state variable cannot be shared with webfarm and webgarden.
Application state variable can be store only server whereas session state variable can be stred at various place described avobe.

To read XMl we can use dataset
