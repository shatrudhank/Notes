Q1.Diffrence between webform and mvc?

  To acces webform we have to pass the aspx page url containing its physical path.
  Mvc support routing
  webform->strongly couple view and code behind file. need to be same name
  mvc-can have different view based onn condition.

  ASP.NET Web Forms application, every URL must match with a specific .aspx file. For example, a URL http://domain/studentsinfo.aspx must match with the file studentsinfo.aspx that contains code and markup for rendering a response to the browser.
  Routing is not specific to MVC framework. It can be used with ASP.NET Webform application or MVC application.
  ASP.NET introduced Routing to eliminate needs of mapping each URL with a physical file.

Html.Raw renders what it is given without doing any html encoding, so with ViewBag.div = "<div> Hello </div>";:

@Html.Raw(ViewBag.div);
Renders

<div> Hello </div>

Action verb cannot be applied to Index action method. We also cannot overload index action method.
