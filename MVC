Diffrence between webform and mvc?
webform request- request->view->codebehind file>view
mvc- request->action->view
webform->strongly couple view and code behind file. need to be same name
mvc-can have different view based pn condition.


Html.Raw renders what it is given without doing any html encoding, so with ViewBag.div = "<div> Hello </div>";:

@Html.Raw(ViewBag.div);
Renders

<div> Hello </div>
